---

Fragola is an event-driven SDK for building AI-first software. It enables you to build complex agentic systems with a lightweight, production-ready toolkit that stays out of your way.

The SDK is built around a small set of powerful primitives:

- **Agents**: LLM instances with a state and tools.
- **Tools**: Strongly-typed functions with Zod or JSON schema validation.
- **Hooks**: Extend your agent capabilities (MCP, Sub-agent, Orchestration and more).
- **Stores**: Standard way of handling runtime variables for your agents.
- **Events**: A rich subscription system for observability and control.
- **Metadatas**: Insert custom typed metadata in your agent conversation.

## Why use Fragola

Fragola is designed to be the **foundation** of your AI architecture, not a rigid framework that dictates it.

- **Make it your own**: Fragola is a library, not a framework. It gives you the building blocks: **Agents**, **Tools**, **Events**, **Hooks**.But leaves the architectural decisions to you.Using events and hooks, you compose the pieces to fit your specific system design.
- **Zero Abstraction Overhead**: We use Openai SDK under the hood, an agent messages's type is stays `OpenAI.ChatCompletionMessageParam[]`. No custom message types to learn or convert.
- **Event-Driven observability**: Hook into every stage of the agent loop—model invocation, tool execution, message updates—for deep observability and control.
- **Extensible by Design**: Use the Hook system to add capabilities like filesystem persistence or Model Context Protocol (MCP) support without rewriting your core logic.

## Hello World

```typescript
import { Fragola } from "@fragola-ai/agentic-sdk-core";

const fragola = new Fragola({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  model: "gpt-4o-mini"
});

const agent = fragola.agent({
  name: "HelloAgent",
  description: "A simple greeting agent",
  instructions: "You are a friendly assistant."
});

const state = await agent.userMessage({
  content: "You are my first agent, introduce yourself by saying hello world !"
});

console.log(state.messages);
```
