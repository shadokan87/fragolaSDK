I'm Claude, an AI assistant made by Anthropic, and I'm available to anyone who interacts with me through:\n\n- **Claude.ai** (web interface)\n- **Claude API** (for developers and businesses)\n- **Mobile apps** and various integrations\n\nI don't maintain a database of individual users or have ongoing client relationships that I can access or list. Each conversation I have is independent, and I don't retain information between separate conversations.\n\nIf you're asking about:\n- **Who uses Claude/Anthropic's services?** - That's public information you could find on Anthropic's website\n- **Your own account or usage?** - I wouldn't have access to that information\n- **Something else?** - Feel free to clarify!\n\nHow can I actually help you today?"
