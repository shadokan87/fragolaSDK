I'm Claude, an AI assistant made by Anthropic. \n\nI don't have:\n- A client roster or customer list\n- Persistent relationships with individual users\n- Memory of previous conversations\n- Access to information about who uses me\n\nEach conversation I have is independent. I'm available to anyone who accesses me through:\n- **Claude.ai** (Anthropic's web interface)\n- **Claude API** (for developers and companies building with Claude)\n- **Various integrations** (apps and services that use Claude)\n\nIf you're asking about something specific—like whether a particular organization uses Claude, or if you're trying to find information about Anthropic's partnerships—I'd be happy to help if I can! Could you clarify what you're looking for?"
